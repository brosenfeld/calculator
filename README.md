## Interface
* Appropriate numerical buttons are made available for the base.
* Changes between signed and unsigned are reflected in the available operations.
* Changes in bit length are shown in the binary representation.
* Can use keyboard for input
* Show appropriate combination of accumulator, operand, active operator, or error.

## Display
* Entering positive or negative numbers properly shows decimal, binary, and hex and does bounds checking.

## Calculator
* Handles changes in modes (bit length, base, and is signed).
* Catches binop errors and stores the message in an instance variable.
* Passing unit tests for control flow, operations, and different modes.
