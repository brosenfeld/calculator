# About
This calculator is designed for systems programmers and consumer scientists. It supports 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit signed and unsigned numbers, and it allows users to cast numbers between any of these modes. Users can also enter numbers as binary, hexadecimal, or decimal inputs, and the calculator display simultaneously shows all three of these bases.

The calculator is available through the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/programmers-calculator/pgkgdlpegifkoofoioopnbkkfhjociaj?hl=en-US&gl=US). With the Chrome Apps for Mobile Toolchain, the calculator can be built into Android and iOS apps.
